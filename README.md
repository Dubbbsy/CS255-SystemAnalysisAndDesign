# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
#    The client for the project was DriverPass and they wanted a system for their company where their customers would be able to buy packages, set up appointments, and view their progress. Some of the features for the system was the ability to access purchased practice tests, #    view feedback from instructors, and create new appointments all in the same system.
#
# What did you do particularly well?
#    For this project I feel that I was able to accurately determine exactly what all of their needs were based off provided use cases and user stories and take that information to then create varius UML diagrams.
#
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#    One thing that I would go back to revise would probably be my process model for the system.
#
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#    Rather than just directly taking what the user asked for, I looked more towards how exactly it would be used and inquired about all the different ways that the client thought the system would end up being used. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a #    system so that all of the possible uses are covered minimizing the amount of additional changes later on.
#
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
#    My approach to designing software starts with gathering all of the requirements and using those to create an outline through diagrams such as object models. Once that is completed I seperate the system into different pieces, completing them one at a time and testing each  #    one as they are finished.
